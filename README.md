# React Native Todos

Welcome to this tutorial on how to build a full-stack mobile application with Amplication.

This guide assumes that you have, at minimum, a working understanding of the following:

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- An IDE

As well as having, at minimum, a basic understanding of the following:

- REST APIs
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

You'll also need an Amplication account, [visit here](https://app.amplication.com/login) to create one.

What we will do is go step by step to create a `Todos` application using React Native for your frontend and Amplication for your backend.
